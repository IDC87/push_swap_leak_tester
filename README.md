# push_swap_leak_tester
a very basic push_swap tester. Mostly for checking leaks in all common scenarios

I made it for myself but got carried away and decided to create something more apealing.

- just clone this repo and copy the script to the root of your project
- run bash test_leaks.sh

!!! you will need to have the checker if you want to run the last part, also change its name to just "checker"

If you encounter any errors please feel free to contact me, all feedback is apreciated!
